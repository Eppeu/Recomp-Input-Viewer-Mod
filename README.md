## Majora's Mask Recompiled Input Viewer
This is a Recomp mod that adds an input viewer for Majora's Mask Recompiled.

It lets you change the position of the input viewer on the screen.

The input viewer lets you also add the L button to show the use of it in some other mods like the Randomizer.

It also gives you the possibility to have the Gamecube controller layout.

It also gives you an option to show the Extended Superslide (ESS) zone of your stick to learn this trick. When the stick is black, it means that you are in the deadzone in which no input from your stick is registered. If it is in green, it means that you are in the ESS zone and can do tricks like the Hyper Endless Superslide (HESS) and when the stick is in red, it means that you are outside of the ESS Zone.

Finally it lets you change the color of some of the buttons (A,B,Start, C Buttons, Triggers, DPad and the analog) using a hex value (i.e: F5A9B8)
